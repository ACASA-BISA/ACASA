For example, heat stress in rice is defined when maximum temperature exceeds 43°C. For livestock, such as cattle, heat stress was characterized using the Temperature Humidity Index (THI), with values exceeding 81 classified as hazardous. Intensity classes were determined using expert-informed k-means clustering, and frequency was categorized using statistical return period analysis. Finally, a combined hazard score—calculated as the product of intensity and frequency classes—was reclassified into five standard hazard categories for consistent spatial analysis. For baseline, the hazards are based on the Climate Hazard Centre’s CHIRPS and CHIRTS temperature and precipitation datasets. For future, deltas are computed for 5 CMIP6 models (GFDL-ESM4, IPSL-CM6A-LR, MPI-ESM1-2-HR, MPI-ESM2-0, UKESM1-0-LL) downscaled to 50km by ISIMIP group.

These models simulate crop growth and yield under varying climatic, soil, and management conditions, making them suitable for evaluating crop responses across spatial and temporal scales. In ACASA, these point-based models were integrated into a MATLAB-coded utility to enable high-resolution spatial crop simulations. The models were spatially calibrated using regional varietal data on phenological durations and district-level yields, allowing adjustment of regional genetic coefficients.
        
        The high-resolution input dataset included sowing dates, nitrogen application rates (from fertilizer census data and recommended doses), soil profiles (sourced from ISRIC, ISRO, and field surveys), and an irrigation mask. This dataset was used to conduct spatially gridded crop simulations across the entire South Asian region. Developed specifically for South Asia at a 5x5 km spatial resolution, it integrates both local and global datasets (Shirsath et al., 2025 – unpublished).
        
        The calibrated crop models were used to simulate yields under both baseline (1984–2013) and future climate scenarios (2035–2064 and 2065–2094), for emission pathways SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5.

The process began with identifying and reviewing climatic hazards affecting major agricultural commodities, followed by mapping adaptation strategies to these hazards based on their demonstrated effectiveness and contextual relevance. The identification process was informed by expert insights, historical data, and documented case studies, ensuring that the adaptation options considered were both practical and evidence based.

        To build a comprehensive database of adaptation strategies, a heuristic approach was employed, starting with a systematic literature review. This was complemented by a desk review of grey literature, including reports from agricultural research institutions, NGOs, and government agencies, as well as workshop outputs and survey data. In the next phase, data collected from literature and desk reviews were synthesized and analyzed. Adaptation options were categorized based on climatic region, landforms, soil types, and irrigation or water availability contexts, allowing identification of strategies best suited to specific environmental settings. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments were conducted to evaluate feasibility, effectiveness, and socio-economic impact. This categorization laid a strong foundation for mapping adaptation suitability across the region.

        A key component of the methodology was expert and stakeholder engagement through a dedicated consultation workshop, where identified adaptation options were reviewed and validated. Following validation, suitability mapping was carried out by integrating spatial data on climate, soil, and landform with the identified adaptation strategies using a heuristic-based mapping approach. This assessed the match between adaptation options and regional conditions, considering factors such as risk reduction potential, implementation feasibility, and socio-economic benefits. The resulting maps visually indicate where each adaptation option would be most effective across South Asia.

        To ensure technical robustness and stakeholder engagement, adaptation options were further validated using an interactive web-based platform. The platform enabled a feedback loop, allowing stakeholders to provide real-time input and suggestions, which informed iterative refinement of the suitability maps. This approach ensured that the final maps were both scientifically rigorous and practically relevant, tailored to the diverse needs and conditions of South Asian agriculture.`,

First, through stakeholder workshops, we obtain feedback on the suitability scores of various technologies from workshop participants. The gender suitability is assessed in six dimensions, i) reduction in labor requirement; ii) timesaving; iii) drudgery reduction; iv) market dependency; v) ease of application and vi) influence on decision making.

        To construct a technology-specific composite index for gender suitability and spatial mapping, first, participant results on the six dimensions of gender suitability across adaptation options were summarized. Second, index weights were calculated for cultivators and agricultural laborers from workshop outputs. Third, gender suitability composite scores were computed for each adaptation option, separately for cultivator and agricultural laborer. Fourth, scores were then converted to spatial scores for mapping using the proportion of female cultivators and laborers in the total population across grids of South Asia.

Similar to the price data, cost of cultivation figures were sourced from published government data at the district or division level. For India, plot-level cost data was utilized from government databases.

        The BC ratio was calculated by dividing the value of production by the total paid-out cost, which includes expenses for inputs, labor, and rental value of land. Baseline cost of cultivation data was downscaled to the ACASA resolution using a Bayesian kriging approach.
        
        Since direct estimates of the cost of implementing adaptation options are not available at large spatial scales, profitability was estimated using cost-change assumptions derived from published and unpublished literature, including meta-analyses.
